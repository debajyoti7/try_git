In this thesis, the author presents methods to create a scale-free network fir for his purpose by following a slightly modified form~\ref{alg1} of the B-A Algorithm, and then he goes on to simulate an environment where two companies are competing to win over the agents in the network.
He uses the data gathered to analyse the policies followed by the companies while attracting the customers, and presents his findings which suggest a basic model for maximizing cost to gain ration for the companies.

He also suggests that similar approach could be used in wearable tech to let devices connect and map the social structure of their users, and this model would provide analytical ability over such a network.

The author concludes his work by showing that depending on per unit gain and cost, it is more effective to form long-term relations with the customers for stable or continuous assignments while periodically changing assignments, for eg. seasonal businesses, might reap more profit by not involving the customers to a high degree.
