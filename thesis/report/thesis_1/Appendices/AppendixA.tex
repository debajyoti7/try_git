Scale Invariance refers to the feature that some property of an entity does not change when one of its variable attributes is multiplied by a common factor. 

Scale free networks exhibit this feature, often referred to as dilatation, by maintaining the nature of the connections being formed, irrespective of the number of the agents in the network.
This makes scale free networks more suitable to be used in a simulation that may or may not be need to be scaled.
