Scale Invariance refers to the feature that some property of an entity does not change when one of it's variable attributes is multipled by a common factor. 

Scale free networks exhibit this feature, often referred to as dilatation, by maintaining the nature of the connections being formed, irrespective of the number of the agents in the network.
This makes scale free networks more suited to be used in a simmulation that may or may not be needed to be scaled.
